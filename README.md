# Pixeltool
Pixel art conversion tool



1. Why did I make this tool

I made this tool because I needed a lot of pixel-style material pictures when developing the Terraria Mod. My own pixel art drawing skills are not good enough, and the pictures generated by AI are not "pixel" enough, so I thought I could draw the pictures first and then use the program to convert them into pixel style. This tool is to make it easy to turn ordinary pictures into pixel paintings suitable for games.



2. Working principle

The working principle of the tool is actually very simple:

First, reduce the picture many times, so that similar colors will be merged.

Then, enlarge the reduced picture to its original size.

In this way, the picture becomes a pixel painting composed of color blocks.

At the same time, you can control how many colors are used in the end to make the picture more concise.



3. How to use

It is very simple to use:

Find an image you want to convert

Put the image in the same folder as the code.

Rename the image to "testinput.jpg"

Run the program

After completion, "outputpixel.png" will be generated in the same folder

You can adjust the effect by modifying the parameters in the code:

Adjusting the pixel_size can control the strength of the pixel sense

Adjusting the palette_size can make the picture simpler or richer

This way you can get the material image that best suits your mod!
